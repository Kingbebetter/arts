> Concentrated in a few hands, big data is a threat to democracy. Social media companies and political data-mining firms such as Cambridge Analytica have built their businesses by manipulating public life using personal data. Their work has helped heighten ethnic tensions, revive nationalism, intensify political conflict, and even produce new political crises in countries around the world — all while weakening public trust in journalism, voting systems, and electoral outcomes.

大数据集中在少数人手里，对民主是一种威胁。社交媒体公司和政治数据挖掘公司像剑桥分析公司通过个人数据操纵公共生活建立起自己的商业模式。他们的工作加剧了民族紧张局势，他们的工作帮助加剧了种族紧张关系，恢复了民族主义，加剧了政治冲突，甚至在世界各国制造了新的政治危机——所有这一切都削弱了公众对新闻业、投票制度和选举结果的信任。


> Such crises[危机] are symptoms[征兆] of a deeper problem: the effective monopoly[垄断] that a handful of technology firms have gained over a wealth of information relevant[有关的，确切的] to public life. Fixing the situation requires putting the public back in charge of its data.

这些危机是更深层问题的征兆：一小撮科技公司获得了与公共生活有关的大量信息的有效垄断。修复这些问题需要大众对自己的数据负责。

> Democracy[民主政治，民众] has long been predicated[断定，表明] on, and reinforced[加强] by, social institutions[机构] that carefully collect information about public life and collective needs. Today, however, a handful of technology companies have far exceeded[超过] the data-gathering[数据采集] capacity[容量] of all other kinds of organizations. 

民众已经断定，社会机构正加紧收集公共生活信息和集体需求。然而当今一些高科技公司收集的信息已经远远超过其他组织结构的信息总和。

> These private firms possess[掌握] detailed information on the public — and having collected and stored data on every user’s attitudes, aspirations, and behaviors, they then use it to serve their bottom line. Social media platforms are designed to deliberately[故意的] exploit[开拓、利用] the common predilection[偏好] for selective exposure[曝光] — the tendency[倾向] to favor information that confirms pre-existing views — to reinforce messaging from advertising clients, lobbyists[说客], political campaign managers[政治竞选经理], and even foreign governments.

这些私人公司掌握公众的详细信息，收集存储了每个用户的态度、愿望和行为，然后他们用这些来为自己的底线服务。社交媒体平台被故意设计成利用公众偏好来选择性暴露，信息偏好倾向来证实之前已经存在的观点的倾向，来加强广告客户的信息传递，说客，政治竞选经理，甚至外国政府。

> There are two ways to protect democracy from the challenge posed by tech companies’ dominance[支配] over socially valuable data. The first option is for governments to regulate[管控] content on an unprecedented[空前的] scale. That would oblige[强制] public regulators[监管者] to either review all social media content to judge its appropriateness[适当] or provide clear signals to private firms — whether the social media companies themselves or third parties — to perform such content reviews. But the problem with both scenarios[情节] is that they would create massive[大量的] new censorship mechanisms [审查机制] that would further threaten democratic culture.

有两种方法来应对高科技公司对社会有价值信息的支配给民众带来的挑战。第一个观点是政府加强管控内容范围。这就强制公共监督者既不审查所有的社交媒体内容来判断是否适当也不提供清晰的信号给私人公司， 无论社交媒体公司自己活第三方结构去提供这些内容审查。但是两个都会导致的问的是这将会创造大量的审查机制，将会对民众文化产生深远影响。

> Far preferable would be market regulations that guide firms on how and when they can profit from information about individuals. Such regulations would put the public back in charge of a valuable collective resource while still allowing citizens to express themselves individually by deciding what to do with their data. To get there, policymakers should focus on five basic reforms, all of which would put public institutions back into the flow of data now dominated by private firms.
